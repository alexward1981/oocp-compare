# Technical Debt
Any development tasks or optimisations which need to be made should be listed here.

**Note:** If there is a task/bug manager in place to cover this then this file will not be updated.

## Tasks:
1. Add 404 catching to invalid routes
2. There is some repeating styling happening, this needs to be identified and made DRY.

## Issues
1. There is a floating issue on the detail page. I had to add 'clear both' to the case studies components
2. The spacing between components needs to be standardised, maybe make this a variable value.
