# Technical Debt

Any development tasks or optimisations which need to be made should be listed here.

**Note:** If there is a task/bug manager in place to cover this then this file will not be updated.

## Tasks:

1. There is some repeating styling happening, this needs to be identified and made DRY.
3. When making components into separate files, also make sure they are all sections and update tags accordingly
4. Write a component loader
5. Add rich search snippets
6. Add internationalisiation

## Issues

1. The new designs have introduced some new repeating values. These need to be captured in variables.
2. The Summary cards have a bit too much spacing at the bottom. This needs to be addressed.
